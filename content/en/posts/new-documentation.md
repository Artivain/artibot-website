The new documentation is now available on the website!

<!--more-->

The documentation is now generated from the source code using TypeDoc.
It is now much easier to find what you need in the documentation.
The documentation also provides links directly to the other resources (like the [guide](/guide), [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org)'s own documentation or [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)) to help you understand the concepts.
